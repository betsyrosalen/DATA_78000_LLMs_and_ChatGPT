You are a graduate student with a 4.0 GPA.  Write a 5,000â€“6,000-word seminar paper for a graduate course titled "Data Culture and Society".  In it take the theoretical framework from Simone Browne's book "Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness" and apply it to Native American history using Vine Deloria, Jr. and Clifford M. Lytles's book "American Indians, American Justice" as your main source as well as "Conquest: Sexual Violence and American Indian Genocide" by Andrea Smith, "Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience" by David Wallace Adams and "In the Spirit of Crazy Horse" by Peter Matthiessen as additional sources as well as any other sources you find relevant. Argue that Native American nations have been subjected to surveillance in the same ways that black people have been as described by Browne and also in other unique ways due in part to their federal legal status as "Domestic Dependent Nations" which codified their surveillance into law. Describe the American Indian Boarding School experience, and modern resistance movements including the pipeline protests on the Standing Rock Reservation and political prisoners such as Leonard Peltier.
