LOCKE: DISCIPLINARIAN OR PUSHOVER?

INTRODUCTION
In his book, Some Thoughts on Education, John Locke offers suggestions for parents and teachers on how to best educate children.  While at times Locke’s suggestions may seem harsh, he is fully aware of the apparent severity of his words and tempers them with explanatory comments further on in the book.  Overall, Locke’s philosophy was to treat students with a degree of understanding, caring, and respect that “seemed heretical to many educators of Locke’s time” (Cahn, 1997, p. 144).  The balance between harsh discipline and overly indulgent permissiveness that Locke attempted to express in his book is an ideal that we continue to strive for both at home and in schools today.

DISCIPLINE VS. INDULGENCE
The beginning sections of Some Thoughts on Education stress the need to enforce strict discipline at a very early age in order to accustom children to denying their desires so that it may become habituated and natural in them.  Locke makes harsh sounding assertions like, “children should be used to submit their desires, and go without their longings, even from their very cradles,” (Locke, 1997, p. 146) and “fear and awe ought to give you the first power over their minds” (Locke, p. 147).  Locke claims self-discipline is the, “great principle and foundation of all virtue and worth” (Locke, p. 145) and as such should be taught early while the mind is “most tender, most easy to be bowed” (Locke, p. 145) and before they “have memories to retain the beginnings of it [so that it] will seem natural to them and work afterwards in them, as if it were so” (Locke, p. 148).  He stops short of, and cautions against, breaking the child’s spirit however, since he claims, “dejected minds, timorous and tame, and low spirits, are hardly ever to be raised, and very seldom attain to anything” (Locke, p. 148).
Later sections of the book take a totally different tone however, after Locke states, “I have spoken so much of carrying a strict hand over children, that perhaps I shall be suspected of not considering enough what is due to their tender age and constitutions.  But that opinion will vanish, when you have heard me a little farther” (Locke, p. 148) and I think this is so.  He explains that he does not in any way recommend the harsh corporal punishment practices that were common in his day.  In fact, he emphatically asserts that harsh punishments do much more harm than good since, “this sort of correction naturally breeds an aversion to that which it is the tutor’s business to create a liking to” (Locke, p. 149).  He insists that children should always be treated with “kindness and respect” (Locke, p. 156) and that, “none of the things they are to learn should be made a burden to them, or imposed on them as a task” (Locke, p. 154).  He advocates treating children as “rational creatures” since it is only in this way that we can teach them to be rational adults.  
It is clear from many passages throughout the book that Locke is doing more than lip service to the idea that children thrive only when they are treated with love and kindness.  He claims that “it is impossible children should learn anything whilst their thoughts are possessed and disturbed by any passion, especially fear” (Locke, p. 159), and so asserts that a teacher should, “add sweetness in all his instructions; and by a certain tenderness in his whole carriage, make the child sensible that he loves him, and designs nothing but his good” (Locke, p. 147).  It is through the child’s returned affection that Locke believed a teacher may, “spur them to their duty, and make them find a pleasure in complying with his dictates” (Locke, p. 160).

ANALYSIS
Locke’s views in many ways were far ahead of his time.  He suggested differentiation of lessons based on students’ interests and abilities, which is a concept that has become popular and begun to be implemented in public school systems only in the last few decades.  In his words, “Study their natures and aptitudes, and see… what turn they easily take, and what becomes them; observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for” (Locke, p. 153) and “There are scarcely two children who can be conducted by exactly the same method” (Locke, p. 160).  Locke also accurately anticipates the findings of recent research showing that reward systems, while effective in getting children to do what you want them to do, are detrimental in education because they undermine students’ intrinsic motivation to learn (Locke, p. 150).  His recommendation to use praise to reinforce good behavior and indifference to discourage bad behavior, anticipate the behavior modification methods promoted by B. F. Skinner in the second half of the 20th Century (Locke, p. 151).  Finally, Locke asserted that children’s curiosity should be indulged since it is “natures device for removing ignorance” (Yolton, 1998, p. 186) and that learning should be made meaningful to the child’s life and FUN! (Locke, p. 155, 158-159)  Those are concepts that were unheard of in his day.  

CONCLUSION
Locke does little to explain how we can reconcile the strict discipline and somewhat indulgent leniency that he recommends in turn, except to say that, “he that has found a way to keep up a child’s spirit, easy, active, and free; and yet, at the same time, to restrain him from many things he has a mind to, and to draw him to things that are uneasy to him; he, I say, that knows how to reconcile these seeming contradictions, has, in my opinion, got the true secret of education” (Locke, p. 148-149).  How true!  This is the same balance educators struggle to achieve today; to engage and motivate students to learn while meeting the demands of a curriculum designed to prepare students for state mandated standardized tests.

On the Surveillance of Indigeneity: 
Domestic Dependent Nations, American Indian Boarding Schools, and Modern Resistance
By Elizabeth Rosalen - December 20, 2022
Introduction
Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, by Simone Browne, documents what she refers to as the “facticity of surveillance in black life”  and the impact of this fact on the lived experiences of Black people in America both today and historically. In this paper I plan to show how the same theoretical framework Browne used in Dark Matters, when applied to Native Americans, illuminates a similar but also distinctly indigenous history of control and oppression through surveillance carried out by the same forces that sought to surveil Blackness. Browne touches very briefly on the surveillance of Indigenous peoples in Chapter 2, but only as an aside, noting that they were subjected to the same lantern laws “that marked black, mixed-race, and Indigenous people as security risks in need of supervision after dark.”  What I hope to do with this paper is show how Indigenous people in America were subjected to the same intense scrutiny of their every move that black people were subjected to, and for essentially the same reasons, fear and control, but in different contexts and with different outcomes. In the same way that Black people were corralled and held captive on slave ships like the Brooks and on plantations, Indigenous people were corralled and held captive in smaller and smaller geographic regions, sometimes far from their ancestral lands, that eventually became the Native American reservations that we have today. Just as Black people were subjected to “the experience of epidermalization, where the white gaze fixes him as an object among objects”  so too were Indigenous people, but with different underlying assumptions and expectations about who they were and why they needed to be observed. As Browne sought to question “what would happen if some of the ideas occurring in the emerging field of surveillance studies were put into conversation with the enduring archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlife,”  I hope to do the same for the history of the occupation of indigenous lands in America and its continuing consequences. 
For the sake of brevity I will not go into detail about key concepts of surveillance studies as a field, but instead refer the reader to the Introduction of Dark Matters  for these, except to note that here, as in Dark Matters, I am striving for a “more nuanced understanding of the sometimes discreet and varying ways that surveillance operates”  as opposed to defining surveillance “as something inaugurated by new technologies, such as automated facial recognition or unmanned autonomous vehicles (or drones)” . Key to understanding this more nuanced definition is the term “racializing surveillance” which Browne defines as “a technology of social control where surveillance practices, policies, and performances concern the production of norms pertaining to race and exercise a ‘power to define what is in or out of place’… [and] signals those moments when enactments of surveillance reify boundaries, borders, and bodies along racial lines, and where the outcome is often discriminatory treatment of those who are negatively racialized by such surveillance.”  As I will make clear, this type of racializing surveillance pervades almost every time period and aspect of Native American history since the arrival of white settlers as well as their contemporary existence as Browne argues it does for blackness.
Just as Dark Matters was not intended to be a comprehensive study of all the ways in which Black people have been and are being surveilled, this paper cannot detail all the ways in which Indigenous Americans have been and still are subjected to or impacted by surveillance. I will give only brief outlines of a few important examples that I believe should be studied if we are to understand how, as Browne put it, “racism and antiblackness [and anti-indigeneity] undergird and sustain the intersecting surveillances of our present order” . First, I will examine how the racializing surveillance of Indigenous people in America was codified into federal law beginning in 1831 when Chief Justice John Marshal decided that the relationship of the Native American tribes to the federal government was not one of nation to nation, but that of a “domestic dependent nation… and their relation to the United States resembled that of a ward to a guardian”  necessitating ongoing and increasingly oppressive government involvement in the lives of Indigenous people. Next, I will describe how the forced off-reservation American Indian boarding school experience, “designed to inculcate Indian children with the virtues and values of Western civilization and to eliminate the traces of tribal ‘barbarism’ that their own heritage was thought to represent”  was one of round-the-clock racializing surveillance under the “white gaze.” Finally, I will look at some examples of modern surveillance of Native Americans and show how racializing surveillance is still being used to control Indigenous populations, and to further the colonial objectives of the United States. 
Domestic Dependent Nations
To understand how and why, as I argue, racializing surveillance became codified into federal law, we need to have some background knowledge of the way the legal relationships of Native Americans to non-native white settlers changed and shifted throughout early colonial and American history. In American Indians, American Justice, authors Vine Deloria, Jr. and Clifford M. Lytle describe the beginning of Native American legal history as a time in which due to the strict religious beliefs of the Catholic Spanish Emperor and the advice given him by Francisco de Vitoria, a prominent theologian, in 1532, Native Americans were seen as the “true owners of the land” and as such could not be dispossessed of that land except through “voluntary consent of the aborigines.”  According to Deloria and Lytle:
The impact of Vitoria’s view on European-Indian relations for the next two hundred years was very important because it encouraged respect for the tribes as societies of people. Treaty-making became the basis for defining both the legal and political relationships between the Indians and the European colonists. And when the young colonies finally became the United States, the treaty-making powers that earlier had been exercised by the European nations were assumed by the Americans. 
It wasn’t until almost 300 years later in 1823 that Chief Justice John Marshall “amended Vitoria’s theory… [by suggesting that] discovery did indeed give title to the land and… it was a title that gave exclusive right to extinguish the Indians’ title.”  Indigenous people were seen at best as something like tenants on American land and at worst as a “mere nuisance”  rather than as owners, and as Deloria, Jr and Lytle put it, “Marshall’s definition in effect traded a vested property right for a recognized political right of quasi sovereignty.”  Just eight years later in 1831 Marshall first described the Native American Nations as “domestic dependent nations.” According to Marshall: 
Though subject to the guardianship protection and superior political power of the federal government, Indian nations did possess some degree of sovereignty. Thus, while the tribes did not fall within the category of “foreign nations” that possessed full sovereignty, they did constitute legitimate legal and political entities that could manage their own affairs, govern themselves internally, and engage in legal and political relations with the federal government and its subdivisions. 
This change in status from independent nations with full sovereignty over their own affairs to “domestic dependent nations” with a quasi-sovereignty is what enabled much of the shameful history of Native American-white relations that followed and opened the door for racializing surveillance in the form of excessive oversight and involvement in Native American affairs.
As a direct result of this change in legal status, this early period of Native American-white relations, which Deloria, Jr. and Lytle call “Discovery, Conquest, and Treaty-Making (1532–1828),”  gave way to a period they call “Removal and Relocation (1828-1887)”  during which many forced relocations of Native American people, including the Cherokee Trail of Tears, took place.  It was during this period that Marshall clarified and expanded his “theory of Indian subservience to the federal government” through the use of two metaphors: that of a “landlord-tenant relationship”  and “that of a ward to a guardian.”  Both metaphors imply not only an inherent right but also an obligation of the federal government to be involved in, oversee, observe, monitor, and control the lives of their “wards” and “tenants” in order to protect the people over which they have guardianship and to protect their property. Marshall explained the guardianship relationship and responsibility this way:
They look to our government for protection; rely upon its kindness and its power; appeal to it for relief to their wants; and address the president as their great father. They and their country are considered by foreign nations, as well as by ourselves, as being so completely under the sovereignty of the United States, that any attempt to acquire their lands, or to form a political connection with them, would be considered by all as an invasion of our territory, and an act of hostility. 
While the above description may sound fatherly and paternal in a somewhat comforting albeit overly protective capacity, Deloria, Jr. and Lytle described the other less protective implications of the landlord-tenant relationship this way, “the federal government, as the ultimate landlord, not only possessed the power to terminate the “tenancy” of its Indian occupants but also could materially affect the lives of Indians through its control and regulation of land use.”  While Marshall recognized that the Indian Nations’ right to self-governance had never been ceded, these legal concepts and precedents set the stage for the taking of native lands and government surveillance of and interference in Native American affairs to an excessive degree and became the “theoretical underpinnings upon which federal responsibility for Indians is based.” 
As a result of the legal frameworks described above, during this period, racializing surveillance of Native American people really began in earnest. This is not to say that surveillance did not exist during the period of Discovery, Conquest, and Treaty-Making, but during this earlier period “Indian nations negotiated at least partially from a position of strength”  and for the most part “the white community felt that it could live peacefully with the Indians.”  But starting around 1828, empowered by Marshall’s redefinition of the federal government’s relationship with and role in the affairs of Native people, Indigenous Americans were systematically surveilled and sorted into groups based on the degree to which they had conformed to white and Christian lifestyles and were dealt with accordingly.  Many people and most unfortunately those in positions of governmental power began to believe that peaceful relations between Native Americans and the white settlers was not possible and “saw removal as the most humane way to solve this problem.”  Native Americans who did not sufficiently conform and assimilate into white society (and some who did) were systematically removed from their homelands by force and pushed west “since it was believed that the interior of the continent could not be inhabited by “civilized” people and that there would always be a wilderness populated by tribes of Indians some distance from the centers of civilization.”  This “social sorting of people into categories as a means of management and ascribing differential treatment” is one of the “common threads” that David Lyon saw in “contemporary sites of surveillance”  and it can be seen as an early iteration of Gandy’s panoptic sort that uses data “on and about individuals and groups as ‘citizens, employees and consumers’… to identify, classify, assess, sort, or otherwise ‘control their access to the goods and services that define life… [and] privileges some, while disadvantaging others” . 
Even though Indigenous people were moved westward far from their ancestral homes, ostensibly to separate them from the white settlers and thus avoid conflicts, this did not solve the problems of Native American-white relations and only increased the level of racializing surveillance that they were subjected to. Due to technological developments like the railroad and the discovery of gold white settlers expanded further and further westward into Indian Country. As Deloria, Jr. and Lytle put it: 
From an Indian perspective, life on the reservation was still dominated by white intrusions. The sustenance on many reservations was almost wholly dependent upon some kind of annuity assistance from the federal government. Christian missionaries and teachers flooded the reservations in an attempt to “civilize” and assimilate the Indians. The army was conspicuous in its attempts to provide security, but its efforts were almost always directed at keeping the Indians at peace rather than protecting them. 
From this passage not only do we see the increased degree to which Native Americans were being subjected to racializing surveillance to determine what was “in or out of place” and how they were pressured to conform to these racialized norms, but we also see the beginnings of military “security theater” measures like those Browne describes in Chapter 4 of Dark Matters. Thus, the removal of Indigenous people to reservations only served to make it easier for white settlers, the federal government, and the military to keep tabs on the behaviors and actions of Native Americans and increase the pressure on them to assimilate into white society. 
Only when it became abundantly clear that the policy of Removal and Relocation had been an utter failure in its goal of solving the “Indian problem” did it finally gave way to an equally egregious and ineffective period of federal policy, “Allotment and Assimilation (1887–1928)”  as a “wave of intolerance seemed to sweep across the west.”  It was during this period that two particularly shameful events occurred: the proliferation of American Indian Boarding Schools, and the Massacre at Wounded Knee in 1890.  Both events can be seen as direct outcomes of the racializing surveillance practiced on Native American reservations during Removal and Relocation. The boarding school experience will be covered in some detail in the next section so I will just give a brief explanation of the events leading up to the Massacre at Wounded Knee and its aftereffects here. 
The federal policy of assimilation, at that time “dictate[d] a repression of Indian religious practices simply because religion was part of the larger cultural complex that federal officials thought necessary to eliminate in order to assimilate Indians into the larger society.”   At the same time the Ghost Dance among other “eschatological and apocalyptic religious movements among the tribes promised a redemption by supernatural means and these disturbances, as they were called, prompted repressive measures by Indian agents who saw them as threats to their authority.”  On December 29, 1890, “Big Foot and two hundred or more Minnecojou men, women, and children, with a few fugitives from Sitting Bull’s Hunkpapa band, were slaughtered by the Seventh Cavalry at Wounded Knee… in response to the unwarranted panic of an Indian agent, caused by the ghost dances.”  In response to Wounded Knee, rather than taking a more compassionate approach, the federal government doubled down on their surveillance and: 
On pain of imprisonment, the Lakota were forbidden the spiritual renewal of traditional ceremonies; even the ritual purification of the sweat lodge was forbidden. They were not permitted to wear Indian dress or to sew beadwork, their children were seized and taken away to government boarding schools at the Pine Ridge Agency, and use of their own language was discouraged. They were, however, invited to celebrate American Independence Day on the Fourth of July, which they used at first as a secret memorial to Wounded Knee and later adapted to their own giveaway festivals and powwows. 
From this passage we see that just as “surveillance functioned as a comprehensive and regulating practice on slave life”  so did it serve the same all-encompassing purpose on Native American reservations. We also see in the coopting of the Fourth of July Native American “acts of freedom…[and] strategies of coping, resistance, and critique”  that “took place right under the surveillant gazes of the white population”  similar in form and function to the “black performative practices of drumming, dancing, and chanting” in the Totau and the Catharine Market breakdown.  Like the breakdown, these resistive practices “offer moments of living with, refusals, and alternatives to routinized, racializing surveillance.”

American Indian Boarding School Experience: A Regime of Racializing Surveillance

The American Indian boarding school experience, a deeply troubling chapter in the history of Native Americans, serves as a prime example of racializing surveillance applied with precision to suppress and assimilate indigenous cultures. The establishment of these schools marked a transition from direct territorial displacement to the attempted cultural obliteration of Native Americans. These schools were a result of the Allotment and Assimilation policy, aiming to enforce conformity to white American ideals and dissolve the Native American identity.

In "Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience," David Wallace Adams meticulously details how these boarding schools enforced surveillance and control. Children were forcibly removed from their families and communities, making familial bonds a point of weakness to be exploited. This forced separation served to break down traditional ties, languages, and cultural practices.

The boarding schools subjected Native American children to a rigorous regimen of surveillance, indoctrination, and punishment. Adams describes the authoritarian control, outlining how students were expected to adhere to strict routines and regulations that denied them agency and self-expression. Punishments were meted out for speaking their native languages or engaging in traditional practices. This system of control and surveillance was designed to enforce submission and mold a generation of Native Americans into conforming to white American culture.

This totalizing surveillance extended beyond the confines of the school. The schools collaborated with government and religious authorities to ensure the continuous monitoring and subjugation of Native Americans. Teachers and administrators were tasked with reporting any perceived 'deviant' behavior, enforcing an environment of constant scrutiny and fear.

The American Indian boarding school experience left a lasting legacy of trauma, lost languages, disrupted communities, and fractured identities. The damage inflicted was immeasurable and continues to affect Native American communities today. This traumatic history shaped the ways in which Native Americans view government institutions and the pervasive surveillance that persisted even after they left the boarding schools.

Modern Surveillance and Resistance: Standing Rock and Leonard Peltier

While the overt policies of forced removal and assimilation have changed, the legacy of racializing surveillance and control still persists in modern times. The Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline provide a clear example of how surveillance and suppression have continued to be deployed against Native Americans in recent years.

The Standing Rock protests, also known as the NoDAPL movement, which began in 2016, were a response to the proposed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through sacred lands and under the Missouri River. The response from the government was marked by intense surveillance and suppression, showcasing the enduring strategies used to stifle indigenous voices.

The protesters faced militarized law enforcement, private security forces, and intrusive surveillance measures. The government employed surveillance drones, data collection techniques, and infiltration to monitor and control the movement. This modern manifestation of surveillance aligns with Browne's concept of racializing surveillance, using technology and tactics to reinforce power dynamics and maintain the status quo.

In addition to the ongoing struggle for land rights and environmental justice, Native American activist Leonard Peltier stands as a prominent example of the surveillance and persecution endured by Native American leaders. Peltier, a member of the American Indian Movement (AIM), was convicted for the deaths of two FBI agents in 1975 during a confrontation at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

However, many assert that Peltier's conviction was influenced by the pervasive surveillance and bias against AIM and Native American activists. The case against Peltier was marked by inconsistencies, withheld evidence, and reports of government surveillance and informant manipulation. This case showcases how surveillance can be leveraged to target and incriminate indigenous leaders and activists, stifling resistance and perpetuating an environment of fear and control.

Conclusion

The application of Simone Browne's theoretical framework from "Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness" to Native American history, using works such as "American Indians, American Justice" by Vine Deloria, Jr. and Clifford M. Lytle, illuminates the pervasive racializing surveillance imposed upon Native Americans. From the early legal framework of "domestic dependent nations" to the horrors of the American Indian boarding school experience and the continued surveillance in modern resistance movements, it is evident that indigenous peoples have faced similar surveillance tactics to those endured by Black communities.

The racializing surveillance imposed on Native Americans was designed to suppress, control, and assimilate them into a white-centric society. It was rooted in a dehumanizing ideology that sought to erase native cultures, languages, and identities. This surveillance, both historical and contemporary, has had far-reaching consequences, leaving a lasting impact on the Native American community and their struggle for justice, autonomy, and the right to their ancestral lands.

Understanding and acknowledging this history of surveillance and oppression is crucial to building a more just and equitable society. It calls for a reevaluation of policies, a reexamination of historical narratives, and a commitment to dismantling systems that perpetuate racialized surveillance and control. Only through this critical analysis and collective action can we hope to challenge and transform the surveillance apparatus that continues to marginalize and harm indigenous communities and other marginalized groups.

On the Surveillance of Indigeneity:

By Elizabeth Rosalen - December 20, 2022
Introduction
Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, by Simone Browne, documents what she refers to as the “facticity of surveillance in black life”  and the impact of this fact on the lived experiences of Black people in America both today and historically. In this paper I plan to show how the same theoretical framework Browne used in Dark Matters, when applied to Native Americans, illuminates a similar but also distinctly indigenous history of control and oppression through surveillance carried out by the same forces that sought to surveil Blackness.

Just as Black people were subjected to “the experience of epidermalization, where the white gaze fixes him as an object among objects”  so too were Indigenous people, but with different underlying assumptions and expectations about who they were and why they needed to be observed. As Browne sought to question “what would happen if some of the ideas occurring in the emerging field of surveillance studies were put into conversation with the enduring archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlife,”  I hope to do the same for the history of the occupation of indigenous lands in America and its continuing consequences. 
For the sake of brevity I will not go into detail about key concepts of surveillance studies as a field, but instead refer the reader to the Introduction of Dark Matters  for these, except to note that here, as in Dark Matters, I am striving for a “more nuanced understanding of the sometimes discreet and varying ways that surveillance operates”  as opposed to defining surveillance “as something inaugurated by new technologies, such as automated facial recognition or unmanned autonomous vehicles (or drones)” .

Just as Dark Matters was not intended to be a comprehensive study of all the ways in which Black people have been and are being surveilled, this paper cannot detail all the ways in which Indigenous Americans have been and still are subjected to or impacted by surveillance. I will give only brief outlines of a few important examples that I believe should be studied if we are to understand how, as Browne put it, “racism and antiblackness [and anti-indigeneity] undergird and sustain the intersecting surveillances of our present order” . First, I will examine how the racializing surveillance of Indigenous people in America was codified into federal law beginning in 1831 when Chief Justice John Marshal decided that the relationship of the Native American tribes to the federal government was not one of nation to nation, but that of a “domestic dependent nation… and their relation to the United States resembled that of a ward to a guardian”  necessitating ongoing and increasingly oppressive government involvement in the lives of Indigenous people.

On the Surveillance of Indigeneity:
Domestic Dependent Nations, American Indian Boarding Schools, and Modern Resistance
By Elizabeth Rosalen - December 20, 2022
Introduction
In her groundbreaking work Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, Simone Browne critically examines the pervasive surveillance faced by Black individuals and communities throughout history and its ongoing implications. Browne's framework, although primarily focused on Black experiences, offers a lens through which we can analyze the surveillance of Indigenous peoples in the United States. This paper seeks to apply Browne's theoretical framework to Native American history, utilizing American Indians, American Justice by Vine Deloria, Jr. and Clifford M. Lytles, among other significant works. The aim is to demonstrate that Native American nations have endured similar forms of surveillance, rooted in fear and control, paralleling the experiences of Black Americans. Additionally, this surveillance has been uniquely shaped by their federal legal status as "Domestic Dependent Nations," further institutionalizing surveillance into law.

This exploration will encompass an analysis of the American Indian boarding school experience, examining how these institutions aimed to assimilate Indigenous children into Western culture and how surveillance was employed to reinforce this process. Moreover, we will delve into contemporary instances of surveillance, focusing on the Standing Rock Reservation pipeline protests and the plight of political prisoner Leonard Peltier. Through this examination, we aim to unveil the historical and contemporary realities of surveillance faced by Native Americans, emphasizing the intertwining threads of race, power, and surveillance that underpin the American socio-political landscape.

Racializing Surveillance: A Conceptual Framework
Before delving into the analysis, it is crucial to understand the conceptual framework of racializing surveillance proposed by Browne. Browne defines racializing surveillance as a technology of social control that produces racial norms and exercises power in defining who belongs and who does not. This power manifests in discriminatory treatment towards those negatively racialized by such surveillance. This paper adopts Browne's nuanced understanding of surveillance, moving beyond a mere focus on modern technologies to explore how racializing surveillance has permeated Native American history.

The Beginnings: Federal Codification of Surveillance
The surveillance of Indigenous people in the United States was institutionalized through the federal legal doctrine of "domestic dependent nation" established by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1831. Marshall's ruling framed the relationship between Native American tribes and the U.S. government as one resembling a ward to a guardian, perpetuating the need for continuous and increasingly oppressive government intervention in Indigenous lives. This doctrine laid the foundation for a system of control and surveillance, enabling the government to assert authority and influence over Native American communities.

The American Indian Boarding School Experience
A significant manifestation of racializing surveillance was witnessed in the American Indian boarding school system. These schools were designed to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-American culture, eradicating their tribal heritage viewed as 'barbaric.' The white gaze played a crucial role in this surveillance, subjecting children to round-the-clock monitoring and control. The imposition of Western norms and the erasure of Indigenous identity were achieved through intense surveillance and disciplinary measures.

Contemporary Surveillance and Resistance
1. Standing Rock Reservation Pipeline Protests
The Standing Rock Reservation pipeline protests serve as a modern-day example of racializing surveillance and the resistance against it. Indigenous communities and their allies faced extensive surveillance during the protests against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Law enforcement agencies and private security firms utilized advanced surveillance technologies and tactics to monitor and suppress the protesters, revealing the ongoing struggle against oppressive surveillance practices.

2. Leonard Peltier and Political Prisoners
Leonard Peltier, an Indigenous activist and a member of the American Indian Movement (AIM), remains incarcerated under controversial circumstances. Peltier's case sheds light on the surveillance and legal injustices faced by Indigenous activists fighting for their rights and sovereignty. The political surveillance, biased legal proceedings, and imprisonment of individuals like Peltier underline the persistent surveillance and suppression directed at Indigenous resistance movements.

Conclusion
The analysis presented in this paper showcases that the theoretical framework offered by Simone Browne in Dark Matters is invaluable in understanding the surveillance faced by Native Americans in the United States. By applying this framework and examining historical and contemporary instances of surveillance, it becomes evident that racializing surveillance is deeply entrenched in the experiences of Indigenous communities. From the federal codification of surveillance through the "domestic dependent nation" doctrine to the American Indian boarding school experience and modern resistance movements, surveillance has been a tool of control and oppression. It is imperative to acknowledge these realities and work towards dismantling systems of surveillance that perpetuate racial inequalities and hinder the realization of true equality and justice for all.
