## Part 1 Define your problem

### Promt:

Write a screenplay for a new 20 minute long episode of Doctor Who in the style of writer Ray Davies with Christopher Eccleston playing the Doctor and Billie Piper playing Rose Tyler.  The story should take place in 1960's in the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco where aliens are using the counter culture drug scene in some way to carry out their nefarious plot.  

### Expectation:   I expect the output of this prompt to be pretty bad, a far-fetched a silly plot if it has any coherence at all.  I wanted to try to push the limits a bit in terms of trying to find something it would struggle to do well, so it would be more interesting to see how it performs.
