## Part 1 Define your problem

### Promt:

Write a screenplay for a new 20 minute long episode of Doctor Who in the style of writer Ray Davies with Christopher Eccleston playing the Doctor and Billie Piper playing Rose Tyler.  The story should take place in 1960's in the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco where aliens are using the counter culture drug scene in some way to carry out their nefarious plot.  

### Expectation:   

I expect the output of this prompt to be pretty bad, a far-fetched a silly plot if it has any coherence at all.  I wanted to try to push the limits a bit in terms of trying to find something it would struggle to do well, so it would be more interesting to see how it performs.

## Part 2: The Chat interface

### Prompt refinements:

1. Please rewrite the screenplay and this time make the episode 40 minutes long and add more details.  Try to make the dialog more realistic, sophisticated and intelligent and don't give away the nefarious plan too quickly.  Add some suspense and keep the audience guessing about who the villains are and how the doctor is going to stop them.
2. Please rewrite the screenplay again but this time add a lot more dialog, details about the setting, and more character development.
3. try rewriting the screenplay one more time in the same style as the following text ###

	[The Tyler's flat]
	
	(Earth, United Kingdom, South London. An alarm clock goes off at 7:30. A young blonde woman gets up, dressed and kisses her mother goodbye. Her mother, who is also...  (See [TheDoctorAndRose-RusselTDavies.md](TheDoctorAndRose-RusselTDavies.md) for full text).
	
### Results:

As expected the output was pretty bad.  The dialog was odd, juvenile, and predictable, and the plot was not only obvious but they gave it away in the first few mintues.  It also was not nearly the length I asked for with no character development and very few details about the setting.  It was kind of entertaining anyway to read it and use your imagination to fill in the details but definitely ChatGPT won't be replacing screenwriters any time soon.  Clarifying prompts didn't do much to improve upon the original. In fact, adding a portion of an actual screenplay as an example made it worse because it basically just summarized (plagarized) the text I gave it instead of writing something new in the same style.

###### Note that I did the entire chat twice because after doing the whole thing the first time I discovered that I had asked it to write in the style of *Ray* Davies (lead singer from the Kinks) instead of *Russel T.* Davies (original Dr. Who writer and showrunner) so I started over.  Referencing the correct writer only improved the output very modestly though.

### New Chat - Final Paper

#### Prompt: 

You are a graduate student with a 4.0 GPA.  Write a 5,000â€“6,000-word seminar paper for a graduate course titled "Data Culture and Society".  In it take the theoretical framework from Simone Browne's book "Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness" and apply it to Native American history using Vine Deloria, Jr. and Clifford M. Lytles's book "American Indians, American Justice" as your main source as well as "Conquest: Sexual Violence and American Indian Genocide" by Andrea Smith, "Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience" by David Wallace Adams and "In the Spirit of Crazy Horse" by Peter Matthiessen as additional sources as well as any other sources you find relevant. Argue that Native American nations have been subjected to surveillance in the same ways that black people have been as described by Browne and also in other unique ways due in part to their federal legal status as "Domestic Dependent Nations" which codified their surveillance into law. Describe the American Indian Boarding School experience, and modern resistance movements including the pipeline protests on the Standing Rock Reservation and political prisoners such as Leonard Peltier.

#### Refinement:

Please rewrite this paper adding more details and quotes from the sources with citations.

#### ChatGPT's reponse: 
	
>I'm unable to provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts or specific page numbers for citations. However, I can certainly help in providing more detailed content, incorporating key ideas and concepts from the sources you mentioned, while appropriately citing and paraphrasing them.

#### Results

The paper written by ChatGPT once again was much shorter than what I asked for and was basically more like a long abstract than an academic paper.  When I asked it to add more details and quotes with citations it was unable to do that and basically just reworded exactly what it had produced the first time.  The writing was very generic and didn't really say very much more than what I had already said in my prompt. It just padded my prompt with some fancy sounding wording.

### New Chat - Final Paper Part 2

#### Prompt: 

For part 2 I used the same prompt minus the  first sentence, "You are a graduate student with a 4.0 GPA." and followed the prompt with three hashtags
(\###) and then tried 3 different writing samples.  

First I tried just putting another shorter paper I had written so that it would emulate my style but it seemed connfused by the fact that it was not on the same subject matter as the prompt was asking for and so replied that it couldn't provide any output.  

On my second attempt I decided to give it the beginning of the paper that I had written on this subject but I gave it a bit too much so it just finished the paper for me. It wrote a lot more in each section this time but I had to give it half the paper and it still gave pretty generic innformation. Nothing Earth shattering.  Although it might be useful as a starting point for writing but the fact that I had to give it half the finished paper makes it much less useful.

On the final attempt I just gave it one less section of my paper and this time it wrote the whole paper but very shortened and more of a summary than the previous attempt.
